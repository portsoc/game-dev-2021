# Game Dev Challenge

The scenario is that we're building a web-based game and you're joining the development team.  The game is not finished, but you have been given a basic framework that is working.

To help you get up to speed with the framework the developers have stripped out a few bits of code and want you to add them back in so that everything works.  Once you've achieved this you'll be ready to start developing with the rest of the team.

* Unit tests are in the same format that you have completed previously.
* Tests are all in a file called `test.js`.
* The game library is a file called `lib.js`.
* Your code should be added to `index.js`
* To see the framework for the game _without_ the unit test harness, open `index.html`.
* To run the unit tests you should open `index.test,html`.
* Different panels can be toggled on and off with the `D`, `L` and `P` keys.
* Note that the output of the last test cannot be automatically checked, so you will need to manually ensure that you have completed what is requested.
* Commit your code to GitHub when you're done done.
